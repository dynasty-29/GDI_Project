# GDI_Project
The Gender Development Index (GDI) measures gender gaps in human development achievements by accounting for disparities between women and men in three basic dimensions of human developmentâ€”health, knowledge, and living standards using the same component indicators as in the Human Development Index (HDI). The GDI is the ratio of the HDIs calculated separately for females and males using the same methodology as in the HDI. It is a direct measure of the gender gap showing the female HDI as a percentage of the male HDI.

### Problem statement

United Nations launched its sustainable development agenda in 2015, reflecting the growing understanding by Member States that a development model that is sustainable for this and future generations offers the best path forward for reducing poverty and improving the lives of people everywhere.Gender disparity a variable measured by gender development index is still a problem globally with the claim of the index being higher presummed average of 0.943. Team atreides has been contracted to figure out how we can predict future GDI index. As the Analytics team we will help provide an indication of the global status in terms of gender development while providing insights into some of the key dimensional index that might drive gender development outcomes.We will be performing hypothesis testing to try to prove or disapprove the claim.

### Metric for Success

To determine the gender development index globally.

### Recording the Experimental Design

1)Defining the research question

2)Finding and dealing with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

3)Plot appropriate univariate and bivariate summaries recording our observations.

4)Implement the solution by performing hypothesis testing.

5)Challenge your solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements. Defining the research question


### Research questions

Which countries have the largest and the lowest GDI?

What is the average years of education a female receives in the top GDI(Gender Dev Index) countries vs the least 10 ranked countries?

What is the average years of education a male receives in the top GDI(Gender Dev Index) countries vs the least 10 ranked countries?

What is the average gross national income per capita a female receives in the top GDI(Gender Dev Index) countries vs the least 10 ranked countries?

What is the average gross national income per capita a male receives in the top GDI(Gender Dev Index) countries vs the least 10 ranked countries?
